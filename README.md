## Introduction

Agoraquest is an educational and mental health Virtual Reality (VR) experience that lets you explore social anxiety in Virtual world. This project aims to provide a unique experience for users to overcome social pressure and anxiety by gradually adapting to the discomforts and following guided instructions when needed.

However, it is important to provide a secure and private environment where the user can safely confront their social anxiety at their own pace. In our virtual reality application, we created a virtual world filled with crowded people as in real life, where the user feels uncomfortable and unsafe. By identifying when the user feels overwhelmed or anxious by sensor-based inputs and a button aligned with real-world hardware and virtual-world visuals for panicked situations, the VR experience will provide expert-guided practices or a calming scene of the userâ€™s choice to overcome the fears at a personalized pace. The proposed solution, "Agoraquest," is valuable because it provides the gap of how people with social anxiety feel in crowded environments.Simulating the feeling of people with social anxiety not only understand their behavior better but also guide to the medical treatment in virtual world.

## Design Process

At the beginning of our project, we did some literature research about VR education in mental health people. At the same time, we discussed different scenarios in the group and decided on the final topic of our project. After that, we did a brainstorm about our project concept and selected an engaging and immersive name for our project.
